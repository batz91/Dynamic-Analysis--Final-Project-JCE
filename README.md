Security breaches has existed in every program since ever, but since the rapid development of the internet which let you
now access websites and download program easily, the use of those breaches has been raising.

A security breach in a program or a website is a problem that originated from the way we write code or from other constrains
that give the hacker a full or partly control over the computer that runs the program or the program\website themselves.
There are a lot of reasons why security breaches are created and not discard by there programers. For example:
a dead line must be met for a new version to come out and there for you don't have enough time to check every little scenario 
thoroughly, the lack of the programer knowledge or the lack of attention to a certain error.

This is where we come in, in this project we try to give a solution to those problems and try to prevent the possibility of a computer breach.
